This branch is for compiling cm-13.0 for the Infinix HOT 2

IMPORTANT: Device codename has been updated on this branch, meaning you need to update it locally too. Type the following commands to do so.
Assuming your cm-13.0 repo is named cm-13.0:

- cd cm-13.0 && cd vendor
- mkdir infinix && cd infinix
- git clone https://github.com/Nonta72/android_vendor_d5110_infinix.git -b cm-13.0 d5110
ETA:

- Cyanogenmod 13.0 successfully compiled but it either stuck on bootanimation or on bootlogo (won't get to the bootanimation most of the cases). I hope some devs can help me make it boot, especially @Xen0n , @fire855 , @ferhung-mtk , @rohantaneja , @besik13 , @MSF-Jarvis , @HostZero
Thanks to:
